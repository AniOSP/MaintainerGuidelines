# AniOSP Maintainer Guidelines
### If you are building unofficially, and do not want to be an official maintainer, please ignore this.
------------------------------

1. No blind building (building for a device that you don't own physically)

  a. You are allowed to have other people test for you, as long as they test before the release

2. Don't add unofficial features to the ROM.

  a. Features such as Device Extras for OnePlus devices are permitted.
  
  b. If you would like an exception made/a feature to be added, please let us know!
  
3. Make a list of known issues, and update it.

4. Any ROM-specific bugs that have nothing to do with your trees can be reported in our [chat channel](https://t.me/AniOSPChat).
